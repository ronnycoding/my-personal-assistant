## Skills Organization

Skills are organized by macOS application domain:

- **apple-mail/** - Email scanning, parsing, and organization
- **calendar/** - Event reading, conflict detection, time suggestions
- **reminders/** - Task management and cross-referencing
- **meetings/** - Meeting scheduling and availability finding

## Setup Requirements

**Permissions Required:**
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation → Terminal (or Claude app)
  - Enable: Mail, Calendar, Reminders
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access (if needed for Mail database)

**MCP Servers:**
- macOS control (osascript tool)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronnycoding/my-personal-agents.git
cd my-personal-agents
```

### 2. Verify Permissions
Run the permission verification script to ensure proper access:
```bash
./tests/framework/verify_permissions.sh
```

If permissions are missing, follow the setup guide:
```bash
cat docs/PERMISSIONS.md
```

### 3. Explore the Structure
```bash
# Review agent definition
cat .claude/agents/productivity-agent.md

# Check available skills directories
ls .claude/skills/

# View test framework
ls tests/framework/
```

### 4. Development Status
Check the [Epic Issue #1](https://github.com/ronnycoding/my-personal-agents/issues/1) for current progress and task breakdown.

## Usage Examples

**Daily Planning:**
```
"Review my schedule for today and create a prioritized task list
based on calendar events, emails from the last 24hrs, and existing reminders"
```

**Email Triage:**
```
"Check my unread email and create reminders for anything actionable"
```

**Time Management:**
```
"Find me 2 hours of focus time this week for deep work"
```

**Meeting Prep:**
```
"What's my next meeting and what should I prepare?"
```

## Development

Each skill is a tested AppleScript file (`.scpt`) that can be invoked by agents using Claude's Skills API.

**AppleScript Syntax Notes:**
- Date arithmetic: Use `days`, `hours`, `minutes` directly (not `1 * days`)
- Comparison operators: Use `≥` and `≤` (or `>=` and `<=`)
- String concatenation: Use `&` operator
- Error handling: Wrap calendar/reminder loops in `try` blocks
- Time zones: AppleScript uses system timezone (America/Costa_Rica)
