2. **Follow Timing**: Respect the (00:00) marks for pacing
3. **Use Visuals**: Implement ALL suggested B-roll/graphics
4. **Professional Tone**: News anchor style with personality
5. **Test Both Languages**: Review both English/Spanish if bilingual

### Distribution Strategy

- **Post**: Tuesday-Thursday 10am-2pm PST
- **Hashtags**: Use provided strategy
- **Cross-Post**: LinkedIn for professional reach
- **Team Review**: Share markdown before filming
